# KC Mods
This is a repository of various cache mods for Kantai Collection - KanColle.

# Requirements
You will need a viewer or tool that enables you to perform cache manipulation. One of such is the [KanColle Cache Proxy](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCCacheProxy).

# Installation
Extract a downloaded zip into the cache directory of your preferred tool, observing the directory layout.

# Caveats
- Some of the mods might be from the Flash era, thus at low quality
- There might be weird misalignments, due to differences in dimensions and how KC handles graphics
- You will need to re-apply the mods if an update changes the files
- While cache manipulation of audio/image files hasn't been proven a bannable offence (unlike SWF mods for Phase 1), the repo owner takes no responsibility for malfunctions of your game client, and/or account termination.
